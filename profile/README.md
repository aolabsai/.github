## Welcome on in!

If you're looking for a refuge from the doom or boom of the AI hype shitstorm, you've come to the right place.

We're working on the next layer of the AI stack-- 
* seems inevitable to us that there will be a local layer of AI to ground and contextualize LLMs and pre-trained systems
* we're talking AI that learns via real induction, with self-grounding, in a similar way to animals, because even though [chickens aren't as "smart" as GPT, they don't hallucinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction#:~:text=Domestic%20animals%20expect,to%20the%20chicken.).
* many more things, join us on discord https://discord.gg/Zg9bHPYss5 and our website https://www.aolabs.ai/
