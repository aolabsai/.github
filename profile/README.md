## Hi there 👋

If you're looking for a refuge from the doom or boom of the AI hype shitstorm, you've come to the right place.

We're working on the next-level AI-- 
* we're talking AI that learns via real induction, in a similar way to animals, because even inductivist turkies don't hallucinate like LLMs.
* seems inevitable to us that there will be a local layer of AI to ground and contextualize LLMs and pre-trained systems
* many more things, join us on discord https://discord.gg/Zg9bHPYss5 and our website https://www.aolabs.ai/
